Hangman
-------

I often play hangman with my daughter on a whiteboard.

Today the whiteboard marker was empty. We needed a solution and we needed it now. This is the result.
  
Keep in mind that this is a ten minute hack to be able to play again. (Don't tell me to just change the marker or use paper instead. I am not listening to crazy ideas like that)

Do not read this as idiomatic go code. It was a quick action of the infamous nerd dad.
